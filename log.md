### Day 1: July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dived head first into javascript, learning how to think like a programmer and writing some basic web interactions( alerts, popups ..). I then begun with an example where I coded a Number guessing game but couldnt get it to work. Hit a roadblock and called it a day. It was not so bad of a start

## Day 2: July 17 2020

**Today's Progress**: I recoded the interface of Number Guessing Game and was able to get it to work this time. The issue was related to a case sensitive function I used. instead of 'click' I wrote 'Click'. This solved the issue.
