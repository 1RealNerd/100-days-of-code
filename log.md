## 2 Days Warm Up to Start the Count

## Warm Up Day 1: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed my CSS Skills by completing some challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Learnt how to use a custom CSS Variable, Attach a Fallback value to a CSS Variable and improve browser compatability.

**Thoughts:*** It was a real eye opener learning about Custom CSS Variable because I had no knowledge of it.
