# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## The WarmUp before the Start

## Warm Up Day 0: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed my CSS Skills by completing some challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Learnt how to use a custom CSS Variable, Attach a Fallback value to a CSS Variable and improve browser compatability and built a fake terminal website using HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:*** It was a real eye opener learning about Custom CSS Variable because I had no knowledge of it. Also It helped me recall some stuffs on HTML and CSS
